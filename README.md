# COSC140 lab setup

## Please answer these questions

### What is one thing that has surprised you so far in Cardiff?

The biggest surprise so far has been how similar Cardiff is to the US. A lot of the culture, food, food options, dress are all things I would find in a US city. Cardiff definitely has more of a care for the environment. A lot of packing is made from recycled materials and I've noticed a lot of plastic in packaging is replaced with paper/cardboard where possible.

### What are three things that you hope to get out of your study abroad experience this semester?

- I hope to experience and learn from the education style of the UK - where there is a lot more self-directed learning and few final projects that impact your grade
- I hope to spend some time during my breaks traveling around the UK and (hopefully if the travel restriction is lifted) Europe more generally
- I hope to learn lots of Welsh

## Feedback

I hope you're able to get around the UK and the rest of Europe too!
